# About

Donation Track is there to make all of the donations of organizations or individuals visible to everyone. Organizations and trusted users will be able to lookup their own donations and lookup the donation history of every person who is in need for help.
Based on the donee’s history of donations received, the trusted users will decidehow to proceed with the donation and then store the donation. The trusted users will also be able to post about people who are in need and provide all of the information needed of their status so other people/organizations can help them. Which will help shed the light on the people who are in desperate need of help.

# Competition

After scoping out the market looking for platforms that have the same idea or at least a similar idea to mine, we couldn’t find any. There are no apps that globalize donations and posts about people who are in need in Lebanon. There must be private software for storing donations for bigger organizations.However, others won't benefit from it like they do with the app.The app is also free and simple to use which will make it spread through smaller organizations and individuals.

# Features
